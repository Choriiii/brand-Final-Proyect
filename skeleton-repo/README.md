# Final Project – brand-Final-Project

This project is a responsive web page built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The base design was inspired by a Figma file from the **Flux Academy - Brand Responsive Web Page** project, but I made several modifications to adapt it to my own ideas and goals.

## ✨ Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- Layout created using Flexbox and/or CSS Grid
- Customized CSS styling with personal design adjustments
- Clean, organized code

## 🎨 Original Design Reference
